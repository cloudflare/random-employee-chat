# Random Employee Chats

Random Employee Chats was introduced by David Wragg and the idea is that two randomly selected engineers would meet in person in the office or schedule a 30-minute video call to discuss. You might learn a bit about their work and their team, but also get a new perspective on your own work. There's no fixed agenda, and nothing to prepare.

During the pandemic, direct colleagues or from different teams wouldnâ€™t meet in the office anymore. Having Random Engineering Chats is a good way to keep in touch or meet new people.
